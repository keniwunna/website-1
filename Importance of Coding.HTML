			<div class="Intro"><h2>Programmers are in high demand</h2></div>
			<div class="par"><p>Learning to code will increase your child's odd of securing a lucrative STEM career,especially in a world
				 where computing jobs are growing at over twice the national average.</p></div>
			<div class="Intro"><h2>With programming knowledge,students better understand the world around them.</h2></div>
			<div class="par"><p>Most of us don't know the first thing about what makes our smartphones,laptops,social media networks,and video 
				games run.Basic programming knowledge can change the way we interact with the technologies we use(and take for granted) daily,and can
				 open our eyes to the infinite possibilities of coding.</p></div>
			<div class="Intro"><h2>Programming is fun and satisfying.</h2></div>
			<div class="par"><p>While programming is logic-based,it's also an extremely creative activity. If you know how to code you can develop
				 apps,video games,websites,and more</p></div>
			<div class="Intro"><h2>Coding improves creativity.</h2></div>
			<div class="par"><p>When you learn a language,you use it to express yourself. The same is true with code. Coding empowers
				 kids to not only consume digital media and technology,but to create it. Instead of simply playing a video game or using an app,they
				  can imagine making their own video game,or envision what their own website,or app might look like-and they'll have the outlet of
				   expression.</p></div>
			<div class="Intro"><h2>Coding improves problem solving</h2></div>
			<div class="par"><p>When kids code,they take complex problems and break them down into smaller parts.</p>
			<p>Kids learn what it's like to approach a problem the way a software does,with logical,computing thinking. This logical thinking is a
				 powerful tool in school,work an </p></div>
			<div class="Intro"><h2>Coding improves persistence</h2></div>
			<div class="par"><p>Learning to code,like any new discipline,is a challenge. Thus,tackling complex problems-and making
				 mistakes along the way-can be very frustrating.</p>
			<p>Coding teaches the valuable skill of persistence in the face of such challenges. learning how to problem solve and look for solutions
				 through research and collaboration builds this highly desirable skill.</p></div>
			<div class="Intro"><h2>Coding improves collaboration</h2></div>
			<div class="par"><p>Anyone can learn how to code-kids can learn alongside others of every race,gender or background. Kids
				 meet and learn how to collaborate with all kinds of peers,all joined by a common interest in technology.</P></div>
			<div class="Intro"><h2>Coding improves communication</h2></div>
			<div class="par"><p>Communication is an absolutely essential skill throughout school,work and life. People who can clearly
				 communicate complex ideas in simple terms tend to be successful in different walks of life.</p>
			<p>When kids learn how to code,they learn how to code with the most simple-minded audience imaginable: computers. As mentioned coding
				 teaches kids how to break down complex ideas and arrange them in a way that computers can understand.</p></div>
